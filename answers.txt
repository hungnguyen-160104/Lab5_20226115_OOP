Comparison of Swing and AWT Elements
1. Top-Level Containers in Swing and AWT
Top-level containers in AWT and Swing are used as the base for all components:

In AWT, top-level containers include Frame, Dialog, and Applet. These are heavyweight components, meaning they rely on the native operating system's components and appearance.
In Swing, the corresponding top-level containers are JFrame, JDialog, and JApplet. Swing components are lightweight, meaning they are drawn by Java and can support a pluggable look and feel, making them more flexible than AWT components.
2. Component Class Names in AWT and Swing
Swing components often extend AWT components and add more functionality. Their names are usually prefixed with a "J" to differentiate them from AWT counterparts. For example:

Button: AWT uses Button, while Swing uses JButton.
Label: AWT uses Label, while Swing uses JLabel.
Text Field: AWT uses TextField, while Swing uses JTextField.
Checkbox: AWT uses Checkbox, while Swing uses JCheckBox.
Radio Button: AWT uses Checkbox within a CheckboxGroup for radio button functionality, while Swing provides a dedicated JRadioButton class.
Menu Bar: AWT uses MenuBar, while Swing uses JMenuBar.
Scroll Pane: AWT uses ScrollPane, while Swing uses JScrollPane.
Panel: AWT uses Panel, while Swing uses JPanel.
In summary, Swing components are more advanced, flexible, and consistent across platforms compared to AWT components, which depend heavily on the native OS. Swing also provides additional components like JList, JTable, and JComboBox, which do not have direct AWT equivalents.
